      My Dearest Allie,
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
      A part of your soul lingers in my bedroom, day and night, as the thought of you hasn't left my head. 
      The memories created by our love are all that's left as your scent on my pillow and the indent 
      on my mattress have long since faded just like the invisible force that once attracted us to each other. 
      And yet, despite the distance now between us, I've learned that love is real and what we had will never be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
      From our first picnic date to our last sushi dinner and every "I love you" in between, 
      I will forever remember my first love, Allison.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
      There's so much I could write about, so many words to pour out onto this page. 
      But the truth is, out of eight billion people, the only one I want is you. 
      The only eyes I want to look into, the only fingertips I want combing my hair. 
      The lesson I've learned from losing you tastes bitter, but it has shown me how to be the man you deserve and desire. 
      And if you choose to keep this distance, just know that I'm not chasing you out of a lack of self respect, 
      but because you are worth every ounce of hope I have left. You always have been.
    </p>

    Doing it right this time
    <br>
    <br>
    A foundation cemented by God, where trust replaces jealousy and patience silences fear. A bond no longer shaken by insecurity, but strengthened by faith and commitment. 
    A partnership where we lift each other higher toward success, toward peace, toward a future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Just two people working toward a life filled with love, purpose, and growth every single day.
